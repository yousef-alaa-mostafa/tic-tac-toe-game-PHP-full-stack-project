# tic-tac-toe-game-PHP-full-stack-project
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with added login and signup pages for secure user account management. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery on the frontend, and PHP on the backend.

## How to Play
1. Create a new account or login to an existing one.
2. Start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button.
3. Click on any empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
4. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Features
- Secure user account management with login and signup pages.
- Simple and intuitive Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay.
- Customizable player names and symbols.
- Game progress and user information stored on a MySQL database.
